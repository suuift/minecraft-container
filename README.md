## Description


Docker Container for Vault Hunters Minecraft Modpack

The docker on first run will download the same version as tagged of Vault Hunters and install it.  This can take a while as the Forge installer can take a bit to complete. You can watch the logs and it will eventually finish.

After the first run it will simply start the server.

## Fast Start...

The easiest way to stary using this container is to use the `docker-compose.yaml` as it has everything you need to get going quick.

Simply run...
`docker-compose up`
After a while (if you don't want the console to be stuck in that logging) you can do `Ctrl-C` to shut it down and then `docker-compose start` which will run it as a service instead. Unfortunately on first run you have to do `up` for it to create the environment.

## Requirements

- Make sure that the environment variable EULA is set to `true`
- `/data` mounted to a persistent disk volume - otherwise your world will not be saved !!!
    - Examples:
        - Anonymous volume `-v :/data`
        - Labelled volume `-v vault-hunter-volume:/data`
        - Specific host directory `-v /home/vault-hunters:/data`
- Open up the default Minecraft network port to the host network so that you can connect to the server
    - Note that if you map the port to a different port number on the host the Minecraft Multiplayer user interface will not find the server on the local network
    - `-p 25565:25565`


This is the default world, generated from scratch on first boot
> `LEVEL` Vault-Hunters

## Options

These environment variables can be set at run time to override their defaults.
